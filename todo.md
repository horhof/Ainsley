Have a heading level for each method vs. having a line item for each.

Mention the I/O (parameters and return value) or don't. If you don't, you can just mention it in plain English vs. explicity.

The I/O can be an unordered or ordered list where the return value is just the last item always.

The purpose is either to show on a single screen all the messages. Or the purpose is to detail each method.

Either you mention only the public interfaces or you mention the internal API as well.

Mention the outputs that the object makes or not. It can output to logs, for instance. Useful to mention public logs in some applications. Or to the network disk.
