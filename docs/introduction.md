Apipecto is a system for describing programmatic interfaces in a non-technical, easy-to-understand way. The goal is to know at a glance how the unit is used.

A set of lines describing the unit can be added to the comment to succinctly summarize how a unit is used. Only the public interfaces for a unit are described.
