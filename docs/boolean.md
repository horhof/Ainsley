Terms which are boolean values are called *switches*. Methods which return a boolean value are called *predicates*.

## Switch

```typescript
resetServer(wipeTables: boolean): void
```

> Reset server: wipe tables?.

## Predicate

```typescript
isNetworkSimulated(): boolean
```

> Is network simulated?
