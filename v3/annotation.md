Both [methods](method.md) and [terms of data](term.md) can be *annotated* in order to represent their specific features. For example, a feature of a term is that it may be optional and an optional term is represented in Apipecto differently than one which is mandatory.

## Features

* [Optional](optional.md)
* [Booleans](boolean.md)

* [Lists](list.md)
